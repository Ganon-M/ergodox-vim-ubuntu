This layout is designed for Vim users and also contains mappings to facilitate easy navigation of Ubuntu workspaces, of which I am a heavy user.

The alphabetic layout is QWERTY for two reasons
1. I did not want to have to change conventional mappings in software I use e.g. Vim's 'hjkl' which are designed for QWERTY keyboards
2. I did not want to lose too much familiarity with traditional keyboards as I use the Ergodox as my primary keyboard

# Notes
The layout does not make use of every single key on the Ergodox (in particular the far thumb keys). The reason for this is that they are awkward to reach without contorting your wrists and a goal for this layout was to avoid all wrist flexion if possible.

The RHS island is designed to have your fingers resting on the 'hjkl' keys. This is one key to the left of the conventional QWERTY touch typing position so the letters 'o' and 'p' are slightly more difficult to reach than they ought to be.
